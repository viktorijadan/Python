Logistic Regression

This repository contains the implementation of a Logistic Regression model for predicting CHD (Coronary Heart Disease) sickness over a 10-year period. Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class. In this specific case, the model is tailored to predict the likelihood of developing Coronary Heart Disease over a 10-year period based on relevant health factors.
